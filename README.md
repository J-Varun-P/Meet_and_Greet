# Meet_and_Greet (Web Application based on Flask)

Through this Web application, Students can meet their fellow classmates whose interests align with their own activities.

Students post about their activities on the college page of the web application and interested students can then join in those activities by sending a request to the one who posted the activity.

Students can also search for movies by providing any combination of actors starred in the movie, IMDB rating, movies released in between years to look for a specific movie for a college movie night, SQL is used for running the queries in the backend.
